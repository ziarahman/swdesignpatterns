# Sidecar Pattern

## Simple Explanation
Think of a motorcycle sidecar - it's attached to the main vehicle but handles its own specific tasks (carrying passengers or cargo) while sharing the same journey. In cloud architecture, a Sidecar is a separate container/process that runs alongside your main application container, handling supporting features like logging, monitoring, or configuration.

## Real-World Scenario
Consider a legacy application that needs modern features:

Without Sidecar:
```typescript
class LegacyApp {
    async handleRequest(req: Request) {
        try {
            // Have to modify legacy code to add:
            // - Logging
            // - Metrics
            // - TLS termination
            // - Service discovery
            // - Configuration
            await this.processRequest(req);
        } catch (error) {
            // Error handling
        }
    }
}
```

Problems:
- Modifying legacy code is risky
- Adding modern features is complex
- Cross-cutting concerns everywhere
- Hard to maintain
- Difficult to upgrade

With Sidecar:
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: legacy-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: legacy-app
    image: legacy-app:1.0
    # Main application unchanged
  - name: logging-sidecar
    image: logging-agent:1.0
    # Handles logging
  - name: metrics-sidecar
    image: prometheus-agent:1.0
    # Handles metrics
  - name: proxy-sidecar
    image: envoy:1.0
    # Handles TLS, routing
```

Benefits:
- Legacy app untouched
- Modern features added
- Separation of concerns
- Easy to upgrade
- Independent scaling

## Problem Statement
Modern cloud applications need:
- Logging and monitoring
- Service mesh features
- Configuration management
- Security features
- Health checking
But adding these to existing applications is:
- Complex
- Risky
- Time-consuming
- Hard to maintain

## Solution
The Sidecar pattern provides:
1. Feature Isolation
   - Separate containers
   - Independent processes
   - Clear boundaries

2. Resource Sharing
   - Same lifecycle
   - Shared network
   - Shared storage
   - Same scheduling

3. Zero Application Changes
   - Non-invasive
   - Legacy compatible
   - Easy to add/remove

## Implementation Examples

### Kubernetes Implementation
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-application
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main-app
        image: web-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log
      
      - name: logging-sidecar
        image: fluentd:1.0
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log
        
      - name: metrics-sidecar
        image: prometheus-agent:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090
        
      - name: proxy-sidecar
        image: envoy:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 443
        - containerPort: 80
        
      volumes:
      - name: shared-logs
        emptyDir: {}
```

### Docker Compose Implementation
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  main-app:
    image: web-app:1.0
    ports:
      - "8080"
    volumes:
      - logs:/var/log
    networks:
      - app-network

  logging-sidecar:
    image: fluentd:1.0
    volumes:
      - logs:/var/log
    networks:
      - app-network
    depends_on:
      - main-app

  metrics-sidecar:
    image: prometheus-agent:1.0
    ports:
      - "9090"
    networks:
      - app-network
    depends_on:
      - main-app

  proxy-sidecar:
    image: envoy:1.0
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - app-network
    depends_on:
      - main-app

volumes:
  logs:

networks:
  app-network:
```

### Service Mesh Implementation (Istio)
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: web-application
spec:
  hosts:
  - web-app.example.com
  gateways:
  - web-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /
    route:
    - destination:
        host: web-application
        port:
          number: 8080
---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: web-application
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

## Usage Guidelines
